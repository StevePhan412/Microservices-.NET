Note

In this project, what I have learned is:
- How a ASP.NET MVC project is built
- How to effectively creating microservices with a template Play.Common
and using Nuget Package Manager to package it and referring it throughout the rest of the ecosystem
- Using docker script to build MongoDB
- Handling partial failures between services by adding timeouts for requests to a service, perform call retries number of times with a longer wait between each retry using Polly
